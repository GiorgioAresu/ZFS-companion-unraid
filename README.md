# ZFS companion

This plugins wants to be the sidekick to [unRAID-ZFS from Steini1984](https://github.com/Steini1984/unRAID6-ZFS), adding a widget for the dashboard, and possibly some APIs to get the status (ie. to use with HomeAssistant).

It started as a packaging of [zfs-frontend-unraid](https://github.com/ezraholm50/zfs-frontend-unraid), due to already having the Corsair plugin installed.
